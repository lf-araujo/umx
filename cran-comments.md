## Changes
umx was archived from CRAN without notice to me (due to an update of OpenMx).

This version fixes a handful of warnings and should get it reinstated.

## Test environments
* MacOS 14.0, R version 4.3.3
* Win64 R R version 4.4.0 alpha (2024-03-26 r86209 ucrt)
* 64-bit Linux, R version 4.4.1


## R CMD check results
* All OK

## No Downstream dependencies

Thank you,
