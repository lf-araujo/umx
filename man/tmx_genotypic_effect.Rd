\description{
\code{tmx_genotypic_effect} allows you to explore the concept of genotypic effect at a locus. With it,
you can interactively explore the effects of allele frequency, additive variance, and
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)}{dominance}.

This function lets you explore the simplest twoâ€“allele system (\code{B} and \code{b}), with three possible
genotypes, \code{BB}, \code{Bb}, and \code{bb}.

The point between the two homozygotes is \code{m} -- the mean effect of the homozygous genotypes.

Parameter \code{a} is half the measured phenotypic difference between the homozygotes \code{BB} and \code{bb}.
It corresponds to the additive effect of each additional \code{B} allele, relative to the \code{bb} phenotype.

Parameter \code{d} is the deviation of the heterozygote \code{Bb} phenotype from the homozygote mid-point \code{m}.
It corresponds to the non-additive (dominance) effect of the \code{B} allele. The heterozygote phenotype
may lie on either side of \code{m} and the sign of \code{d} will vary accordingly.

\strong{Old system} from book ed 2:

Adapted from Mather and Jinks, 1977, p. 32). See book issue old-style nomenclature
https://github.com/tbates/BGBook/issues/23

\code{u} = Frequency of the dominant allele (now = \code{p}).
\code{v} = Frequency of the recessive allele (now = \code{q}).

\code{m} = midpoint between the two homozygotes
\code{d} = half the difference between the two homozygote (now \code{a})

\code{h} = deviation of the heterozygote from \code{m} (now = \code{d})

New system:

\code{u} and \code{v} -> \code{p} and  \code{q}

\code{d} and \code{h} -> \code{a} and \code{d}
